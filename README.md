# Malaria Detector

Final project for the [IBM Advanced Data Science Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-science-capstone/home/welcome)

Using the following dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria)

Developed with Python 3.7.5. Libraries and its versions are listed in `requirements.txt`

The project consists on:
- Reading and processing the images of the dataset.
- Applying data augmentation through the Keras::ImageDataGenerator.
- Training a Convolutional Neural Network Model from scratch.
- Training multiple variants of a transfer knowledge model that employs the Inception V3 as backbone.
- Display of the results.

Resulting models were updated through Git LFS
